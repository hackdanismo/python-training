# Run the script by opening the terminal: $ python3 main.py

# Using the print() function to output what to print in the console
# The double quotes are used to tell the computer that "Hello world!" is not code, it's a String (text)
print("Hello world!")

# Using a single print() function to output over multiple lines
# Use the \n character
print("Hello world!\nHello world!")

# Modifiers can be added to text within the print() function
# Using single quotes in-place of double quotes:
print('She said: "Hello" and then left.')
# Alternative option - escape backslash:
print("She said: \"Hello\" and then left.")

# Concatenate (combine) Strings to added to the end of another string
#Â Use a + sign
# Strings have been combined into one with no space between: HelloDan
print("Hello" + "Dan")
# This will add the space as a String by continuing to use String concatenation to become a single String
print("Hello" + " " + "Dan")
